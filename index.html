    <head> <h1> Interneting Is Easy!</h1> </head>
    <h4>First we need to learn some basic HTML.</h4>

    <h1>Headings</h1>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h1>Lists</h1>

    <h4>This is how you make an unordered list:</h4>
    <li>Add a "ul" element(it stands for unordered list)</li>
    <li>add each item in it's own "li" element</li>
    <li>they don't need to be in any particular order</li>

    <h4>This is what an ordered list look like:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li> But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li> Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li> You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Inline Elements</h1>

    <p><em>Sometimes,</em>> you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</hp>

    <p>Other times, you need to <strong> strongly </strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>

    <h4><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></h4>

    <h1>Empty Elements</h1>
